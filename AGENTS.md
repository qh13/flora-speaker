# Agents.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ESP-Claw is an ESP-IDF firmware project for running an AI agent framework on Espressif IoT devices. The main application is `application/edge_agent/`; reusable firmware components live under `components/`. The repo also contains board definitions, build-time FATFS content, documentation, and the embedded device settings UI.

## Development Commands

Export ESP-IDF before firmware work:

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
```

Generate board manager files and build from the app directory:

```bash
cd application/edge_agent
idf.py gen-bmgr-config -c ./boards -b esp32_S3_DevKitC_1
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

Docs site:

```bash
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

Embedded settings UI:

```bash
cd application/edge_agent/components/http_server/frontend_source
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Boot and Runtime Flow

The main entry point is `application/edge_agent/main/main.c`. 

### Core Data Flow

1. IM channels, scheduler jobs, Lua scripts, startup hooks, or CLI commands publish events or submit requests.
2. `claw_event_router` matches events against `/fatfs/router_rules/router_rules.json` and can call capabilities, run scripts, run the agent, send messages, emit events, or drop events.
3. `claw_core` builds context from memory, session history, skills, and other providers; calls the configured LLM backend; executes capability tool calls; persists context; and returns responses.
4. Outbound messages are routed back through registered IM bindings or local/web channels.

## Key Subsystems

- **Application shell** (`application/edge_agent/main/main.c`, `components/common/app_claw/`): boot flow, storage paths, capability registration, Lua module registration, CLI, and agent startup.
- **Agent core** (`components/claw_modules/claw_core/`): request queue, context building, LLM backend runtime, tool-call loop, media inference, interrupts, context persistence, and response delivery.
- **Event router** (`components/claw_modules/claw_event_router/`): declarative event routing and actions backed by router rules in FATFS.
- **Capability registry** (`components/claw_modules/claw_cap/`): common registration and dispatch layer for model-callable capabilities.
- **Capabilities** (`components/claw_capabilities/`): concrete agent capabilities such as Lua execution, files, IM platforms, MCP, skill management, router management, scheduler, session management, time, HTTP requests, web search, system, and LLM inspection.
- **Memory** (`components/claw_modules/claw_memory/`): session history, profile/long-term memory providers, memory persistence, request gating, and stage notes.
- **Skills** (`components/claw_modules/claw_skill/`, component `skills/` directories): user-facing skill documents and activation state.
- **Lua modules** (`components/lua_modules/`): Lua drivers and higher-level modules for hardware, media, HTTP server, storage, threading, JSON, board manager, and capability calls.
- **Board manager** (`application/edge_agent/boards/`): board metadata, peripheral YAML, board setup code, board defaults, optional local components, and optional board FATFS overlays.
- **FATFS image** (`application/edge_agent/fatfs_image/`): base runtime files for memory, skills, scripts, router rules, scheduler rules, inbox, and static assets.
- **HTTP config service** (`application/edge_agent/components/http_server/`): local device configuration server and embedded frontend.

## Code Style

- Implement the module in ESP-IDF using C-style object-oriented design, not C++.
- Represent each module as an object with an opaque handle: typedef struct xxx_t *xxx_handle_t.
- The header should expose only the handle, config, events, callbacks, and public APIs.
- Define struct xxx_t only in the .c file to store object state and resources.
- Use ESP-IDF-style APIs: xxx_create/delete/start/stop/read/write/set/get.
- Use xxx_handle_t handle as the first parameter of object methods.
- Prefer esp_err_t as the return type for public APIs.
- Use const xxx_config_t *config as create input and xxx_handle_t *ret_handle as output.
- Resources must be allocated in create and fully released in delete.
- Internal resources may include memory, GPIO, I2C, SPI, timers, tasks, queues, and mutexes.
- Protect shared state with mutexes or semaphores when accessed by multiple tasks.
- Register callbacks with xxx_register_cb(), using handle, event, and user_ctx.
- For polymorphism, use an xxx_ops_t function pointer table and put base struct as the first member.

## Memory Allocation and Release

- All runtime states must belong to a certain object instance.
- Avoid creating local variables larger than 128 bytes on task stacks; 
- Pre-allocated buffers, memory pools or ring buffers should be used in high-frequency scenarios.

## Testing

- Firmware changes should at minimum run `idf.py build` for the affected board configuration after exporting ESP-IDF and generating board manager config.
- Component test apps live under `components/claw_modules/*/test_apps/`.
- Lua module tests live beside modules under `components/lua_modules/<module>/test/` with descriptive names such as `json_roundtrip.lua`.
- Embedded frontend changes should run `cd application/edge_agent/components/http_server/frontend_source && pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck`.

## AGENTS.md Best-Practice Notes

Use this file as a compact router, not an encyclopedia.

- Keep instructions specific to this repository and this documentation workflow.
- Prefer exact file paths and commands over broad principles.
- Point agents to the right source files instead of duplicating long architecture explanations here.
- Document boundaries and exceptions explicitly, especially when "do not create a page by default" is the expected behavior.
- Update this guide when the docs workflow changes; stale agent docs are worse than missing prose.
